## About

Hi! I'm Xiaoru Guo. My friends also call me David.

<small>
I currently serves as Failure Analsyis Engineer in Lumileds. This is a great team and all members have different research backgrounds. I highly enjoy the high productivity, strong manufacturing support and active research production in the team.

I completed my Ph.D. study under <a href="http://uwm.edu/nsee/" target="_blank">Dr. Junhong Chen</a>’s advising. My thesis was on nanomaterial and semiconductor research for energy and environment.

<small>
During my Ph.D. study, my interest was about nanomaterial structure design and preparation. I also closely worked on multiple manufacturing techniques, material characterization and system design. Besides solar cells, I closely worked on lithium-ion batteries, supercapacitors, capacitive deionization for water treatment and more. I also worked in cleanrooms with our FET sensor team on semiconductor and thin film developments. During my Ph.D. study, I served as our lab safety coordinator and I assisted my PI on lab management. Benefiting from our industrial collaborators, I also have closely worked with multiple companies on research to product transformation and prototypes. Out of research lab, I would love to collaborate with people from different areas, and work on all kinds of innovations, for example, artificial blood cells and smart building windows.

I love to try new things. I build my own 3D printer. I create homemade tools to help my research or just have fun. I’m a big movie fan, especially sci-fi, adventure and mystery films. I always go outdoor for hiking, biking and fishing. Most importantly, I love my wife, <a href="/huilei" target="_blank">Huilei Zhao</a>, who supports and inspires me, and is also a scientist on nanomaterials.
