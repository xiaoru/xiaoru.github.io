## About

Hi! I'm Xiaoru Guo. My friends also call me David.

<small>
My interest is about nanomaterial structure design and preparation. I have worked on multiple manufacturing techniques, material characterization and system designs. I enjoy the process of transforming a theory to applications. Out of research lab, I would love to collaborate with people from different areas, and work on all kinds of innovations.

I love to try new things. I build my own 3D printer. I create homemade tools to help my research or just have fun. Iâ€™m a big movie fan, especially sci-fi, adventure and mystery films. I always go outdoor for hiking, biking and fishing. Most importantly, I love my wife, <a href="/huilei" target="_blank">Huilei Zhao</a>, who supports and inspires me, and is also a scientist on nanomaterials.
