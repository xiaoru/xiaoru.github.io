	<h1>Hi! I'm Xiaoru Guo. My friends also call me David.</h1> 

	<p id="focus">I am currently a Ph.D. candidate under <a href="http://www4.uwm.edu/nsee/" target="_blank">Dr. Junhong Chen</a>’s advising. My thesis is focusing on graphene-based materials for solar cell applications. I have been working with multiple 2D / 3D graphene-based structures, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and their hybrids. Also my solar cell applications are not limited to dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), but also quantum dots and perovskite solar cells.</p>

	<p id="side">My studies of nanomaterial chemistry and physics are also used in lithium-ion batteries, photocatalysts and smart sensors. Besides these, I would love to collaborate with people from different areas, and work on all kinds of innovations, for example, artificial blood cells and smart building windows.</p>

	<p id="hobbies">I love to try all kinds of new things. I build my own 3D printer. I create home-made tools to help my research or just have fun. I’m a big movie fan, especially sci-fi, adventure and mystery films. I always go outdoor for hiking, biking and fishing. Most importantly, I love my wife, Huilei Zhao, who is also a scientist on nanomaterials and supports and inspires me.</p>
